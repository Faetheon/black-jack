# BaseTemplate
A repo to test out different libraries and/or ideas.
If enough people use this I will create a more in depth tutorial for people who don't have much experience with github.

# Required resources
All you need to use this is the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Required knowledge
Know how to navigate your filesystem through a CLI (Command Line Interface)
* [Windows CLI cheatsheet](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf)
* [Unix CLI cheatsheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet#english-version)

# Quickstart
1. Fork and clone this repo or download it directly.
2. When you finish cloning/downloading it open your CLI (Command Line Interface) and navigate to where your folder is downloaded.
3. Run npm install to install required packages
4. Open another instance of your CLI and navigate to the same place.
5. In one of the instances type npm run dev:start and npm run dev:build in the other instance.
6. Open a browser and type localhost:3000 into the url and voila! Hello world.
